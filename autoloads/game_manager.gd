## Single source of truth for top-level scene paths — main_menu.gd, main.gd, and debug.gd
## all navigate via load() on these instead of scattering path strings. Deliberately plain
## strings, NOT preloaded PackedScene consts: preloading scenes from an autoload created a
## resource-load cycle (autoload init → main.tscn → scripts → autoload) that handed the
## client an empty PackedScene. Paths also stay comparable to Node.scene_file_path.

## Set from the main menu before host_game() / join_game(). Flows into the spawn
## dict so all peers know each player's display name independently of peer ID.

## DEBUG ONLY. When true, every entity is mutually hostile — the harness `hostile=1` knob sets it
## host-side (before host_game()) so the attack-of-opportunity trigger can be demoed two-instance
## before monsters exist (M3). Players are never hostile to each other in real play; gameplay code
## never sets or reads this outside the AoO scan.

## DEBUG ONLY. When > 0, the movement referee uses this (seconds) as every glide's BASE per-step
## time instead of the mover's GlideSpeed tier — set host-side via debug.gd's `glidesec=` arg to
## stretch glides long enough to script/observe conga timing. The diagonal multiplier still
## applies on top. 0 = off (normal tier-driven pacing). Never touched by gameplay code.
